# Contributing to ReviewNinja


## Issues

If you found a bug, or have a feature request, feel free to submit an issue letting
us know about it. Even better, send us a pull request, see below for development
instructions.


## Pull Requests

We provide a `docker-compose.yml` to make local development fun and simple.

Prerequisites:
- docker
- docker-compose
- [kitematic](https://kitematic.com) (optional, but highly recommended)

To setup your local environment:

1) Fork this repo

2) Create a GitHub [developer application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)

Just set the homepage and callback URL to anything for now (we will update this later).

3) Rename `docker-compose.example.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`

4) Copy and paste your client id/secret into `docker-compose.yml`

```yml
environment:
  MONGODB: mongodb://Mongo/reviewninja
  GITHUB_CLIENT: *Your generated client id*
  GITHUB_SECRET: *Your generated client secret*
```

5) Run `docker-compose up -d`

6) Set the application URL's

Now that our application is up and running we need to set the callback URL's
so that we can authenticate with GitHub. For example, if your app container
is using `192.168.99.100:5000` you would set the following:

```
Homepage URL: http://192.168.99.100:5000
Authorization callback URL: http://192.168.99.100:5000/auth/github/callback
```

7) Use ngrok to get GitHub webhooks (optional)

For convienence we have included an ngrok container, we can use this service
to forward webhook requests from GitHub to our local machine.

When you enable ReviewNinja on a repo we will automatically create a GitHub
webhook. We need to change this URL to ngrok instead of the default localhost.

In GitHub go to your repo, then settings, then 'Webhooks & Services'. Find
a URL that looks like this:
```
http://localhost:5000/github/webhook/8y7582c037e3f5fs0dpa48f2
```

And change it to your ngrok URL. This can be found in the logs of your ngrok
container. Be sure to keep "/github/webhook/..."
```
http://8795536b.ngrok.com/github/webhook/8y7582c037e3f5fs0dpa48f2
```


## Running the test suites

To run all tests: `npm test`.

For convenience we have following gulp tasks:
- gulp lint (eslinting)
- gulp mocha (server side testing)
- gulp karma (client side testing)

You can run these tasks when developing using docker-compose by attaching to
the App container and running: `npm run lint`, `npm run mocha`, `npm run karma`.
